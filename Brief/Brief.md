# Brief

In your second assignment, you are asked to write code to produce a game of your choice with user interaction of your choice in Processing (Java).

The game must include collision detection or collision avoidance between ** at least 2 objects** created from class files that you create and define (similar to Paddle and Ball in the game of Pong that we studied).

The aim of the assignment is for you to demonstrate your understanding of all the structures seen so far. Specifically, you are asked to include the following:

- At least two user-defined Classes, adhering to encapsulation rules, complete with:
  - fields
  - constructors
  - getters
  - setters
  - Other methods (private member methods)
  
- The usual Processing classes containing the draw(), setup(), etc. This class must use your    user-defined class(es) in an appropriate manner.

- Use of selection (if) and iteration (loops).

- Use of primitive arrays.

- Use of object arrays.

The assignment is primarily based on everything covered in the first 6 weeks. Methods, Classes, Arrays, Games, (Collision detection/avoidance), Event handling.

## Complexity

The complexity of the entire code is important, i.e. the more complex the code, the more marks you will achieve. (see marking scheme).

The Pong game v8 that we covered in lectures and labs is an example of excellent marks for complexity.

## A Suggestion
Pong has many elements common to most games. Build your own unique game. You cannot submit Pong!

You must include specific references to games, books, or websites that influence your assignment.

When submitting it is important that you explicitly highlight how you've met each part of the spec in the reflection.

Writing code that is not part of the game just to satisfy the rubric will not be counted for marks.

# Constraints

# Marking Scheme

There are two components to your overall mark:

- Structure of code
- Complexity of code

# Video 

You must include a video (screen recording) [min 3 mins, max 10 mins] to present your assignment. Allow 5 hours for this. The video must include audio voice narration by you (microphone).

There are many software programs that enable you to record the desktop as a video:

- Zoom
- Apple Quicktime
- OBS (free open source)
- Screencast-o-matic
- Loom
- Camtasia (PC)
- ScreenFlow (Mac)
- SnagIt
- Jing
- ShareX

You will need to upload your video to YouTube as unlisted. Use your student number to login to YouTube. Copy the URL and include in the reflection where shown.

**WARNING:** Allow plenty of time to do your Reflection, make your video, and upload it to YouTube especially if you're broadband is slow.
